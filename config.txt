If you want to use the "AI translate" or "AI anything" feature, 
you need to configure ollama or open-webui or openai-like according to your AI environment settings and set its "enable" to true.

prompt:Calculate the equation below and reply with only the calculated result. Do not include the calculation process or any other context outside of the result
※prompt is used for AI Anything feature

#translate
taget language:english
※The AI translate function does not need to set a prompt because the prompt is already built into the program. 
※It also does not need to set the input language because the AI can automatically determine it.
